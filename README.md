ðŸŽ¶ Interactive Music Project Built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript ðŸŽ¶ Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project where I combined creativity with coding! In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive music player. The goal was to design a visually engaging and functional interface that allows users to play, pause, and control their music with smooth transitions and responsive design.
